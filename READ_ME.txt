1- Before you start, you need to talk to @BotFather on Telegram. Create a new bot, acquire the bot token and get back here.

2- You have to install requirement Libraries. Please run this command in the current folder.
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

3- Open the terminal and run this command: 
telegram-send configure

4- telegram-send will ask for the token you got from the botfather, and then give you a password that you need to message to your new bot on Telegram.

5- You can adjust the settings in the main.py(Email-password).

6- Open the terminal, run and enjoy it ! :)
python main.py
